## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js and npm](nodejs.org) Node ^4.2.3, npm ^2.14.7
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) (`npm install --global gulp`)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) - Keep a running daemon with `mongod`

### Developing

1. Run `npm install` to install server dependencies.

2. Run `mongod` in a separate shell to keep an instance of the MongoDB Daemon running

3. Run `npm run serve` to start the development server. It should automatically open the client in your browser when ready.

## Testing

Running `npm test` will run the unit tests with karma.
